# nanoforms
Simple web app for simple surveys.

Nanoforms is a collection of php scripts you can upload to your hosted server in order to deploy questionnaires and obtain responses.

Nanoforms helps you deploy html forms you create yourself (that is, it does not assist you in questionnaire building) and optionally invite prospective respondents with html emails you create yourself.

Nanoforms stores all data in a single-file sqlite3 database. It allows you to download the survey responses as text/csv for you to analyze yourself.
